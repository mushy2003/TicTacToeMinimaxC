# TicTacToeMinimaxC
Allows user to play a 3x3 game of tictactoe with the computer. However as a result of the minimax algorithm the AI is using, it is impossible for the user to win. 

Future improvements may include: 
  - Using depth parameter in minimax algorithm to limit search of the game tree.
  - Implementing alpha-beta pruning of the game tree.
  - Above improvements would allow the game to be played on larger grids, giving user the choice to choose what grid to play on.
